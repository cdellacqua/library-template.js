# JavaScript library template

All the files and configurations needed
to start a new JS library.

## Features

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) support;
- built-in testing ([mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) for writing tests, [c8](https://github.com/bcoe/c8) for coverage testing);
- demo web page for development purposes;
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) (code style and linting);
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) bundler, configured to output TypeScript declarations and different module formats to guarantee compatibility
  across different targets ([CommonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS), [ESM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd));
- [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) integration to automatically generate documentation.

## Ready to start?

Running the following commands will clone this template into `my-awesome-library`, install all its dependencies and setup the
development environment:

```
npx degit cdellacqua/library-template.js my-awesome-library
cd my-awesome-library
npm i
npm run setup
```

You can now look for **TODOs** in the project files and start
working on your new awesome library!

## npm run ...

This template provides some useful scripts that you can run using the `npm run <script>` syntax:

- `coverage`: runs tests and computes code coverage;
- `test`: tests the application using [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) and [chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai);
- `dev`: starts Vite.js in watch mode;
- `build`: compiles and bundles the library;
- `doc`: runs typedoc to automatically generate library documentation based on type annotations and JSDoc comments;
- `prepack`: builds, tests and generates the documentation;
- `lint`: runs eslint;
- `lint:fix`: runs eslint with the --fix flag;
- `prettier`: runs prettier to verify code-style;
- `prettier:fix`: runs prettier with the --write flag;
- `setup`: runs the setup.js script described above.
